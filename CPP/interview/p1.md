### Define structured programming?

Structured programming techniques use functions or subroutines to organize the programming code. The programming purpose is broken into smaller pieces and organized together using function. This technique provides cleaner code and simplifies maintaining the program. Each function has its own identity and isolated from other, thus change in one function doesn't affect other.

---

### Explain Object oriented programming.

Object oriented programming uses objects to design applications. This technique is designed to isolate data. The data and the functions that operate on the data are combined into single unit. This unit is called an object. Each object can have properties and member functions. You can call member function to access data of an object. It is based on several techniques like encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance.

---

### List down elements of an object oriented language.

#### -> Class

A class is a user defined data type. It serves as a template of the objects. You can define structure and behavior of an object using class. It includes data and the member functions that operate on data.

#### -> Inheritance

Inheritance enables a new class to reuse the state and behavior of old class. The new class inherits properties and methods from the old class and is called as derived class and the old class is called as base class. The methods thus inherited can be extended using overriding facility of C++.

#### -> Encapsulation

The wrapping up of data and member function into an object is called encapsulation. The data is not accessible to the outside world and only those functions which are wrapped into the object can access it. An encapsulated objects act as a "black box" for other parts of the program which interact with it. They provide a service, but the calling objects do not need to know the details how the service is accomplished.


#### -> Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables one common interface for many implementations that allows objects to act differently under different circumstances. You can also achieve polymorphism in C++ by function overloading, operator overloading and implementation inheritance.

#### -> What are the ways to comment statement in C++?

C++ supports two types of comments.
/* */ is used for commenting a block of code.
// is used for single line comments.

### Define Structure in C++.
```
struct StructureName {
    // member variables (data members)
    dataType member1;
    dataType member2;
    // ...

    // member functions (methods)
    returnType memberFunction1() {
        // function body
    }

    returnType memberFunction2() {
        // function body
    }
    // ...
};
```

---

### Explain typecasting.

static cast:  `x = static_cast<int>(3.14); // x = 3`

dynamic cast: `derived* p = dynamic_cast<derived*>(base_ptr); // returns null if the conversion is not possible`

c-style: `int x = (int)3.14; // x = 3`

---
### Define void pointer using C++

In C++, a void* (void pointer) is a special type of pointer that can hold the address of any data type, without knowing the specific type of the data it points to. It is a generic pointer type that can be used to store the address of any variable, regardless of its data type.

```
int x = 42;
void* ptr = &x;

int* intPtr = static_cast<int*>(ptr);
std::cout << *intPtr; // Output: 42
```

---
### When do you use :: Operator in C++?

- Accessing Global Variables/Functions
```
int x = 10; // Global variable
void myFunction() {
    int x = 5; // Local variable
    std::cout << "Local x: " << x << std::endl; // Accesses local x
    std::cout << "Global x: " << ::x << std::endl; // Accesses global x
}
```
- Accessing Static Class Members
```
class MyClass {
public:
    static int count;
    static void incrementCount() {
        count++;
    }
};

int MyClass::count = 0; // Initialize static member variable

int main() {
    MyClass::incrementCount(); // Access static member function
    std::cout << "Count: " << MyClass::count << std::endl; // Access static member variable
}
```

- Accessing Namespaced Items
```
namespace MyNamespace {
    int x = 42;
    void myFunction() {
        std::cout << "MyNamespace::myFunction()" << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "MyNamespace::x: " << MyNamespace::x << std::endl;
    MyNamespace::myFunction();
}
```

- Accessing Base Class Members
```
class Base {
public:
    int x = 10;
    void printX() {
        std::cout << "Base::x = " << x << std::endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    int x = 20;
    void printX() {
        std::cout << "Derived::x = " << x << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Base::x = " << Base::x << std::endl;
    }
};
```

- Accessing Unscoped Enumeration Values
```
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue };
std::cout << "Red: " << ::Red << std::endl; // Outputs: Red: 0
```

---

### Define reference variable in C++.

```
int x = 42;
int& ref = x;


std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl; // Output: x: 42
std::cout << "ref: " << ref << std::endl; // Output: ref: 42

ref = 50;
std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl; // Output: x: 50
std::cout << "ref: " << ref << std::endl; // Output: ref: 50
```
---

### What is function overloading in C++?

Function overloading in C++ is a feature that allows you to define multiple functions with the same name, as long as their parameter lists are different. The compiler will choose the appropriate function to call based on the number, types, and order of the arguments passed in the function call.

```
int add(int a, int b);
double add(double a, double b);

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

int result1 = add(5, 3);     // Calls the int add(int, int) function
double result2 = add(3.14, 2.71); // Calls the double add(double, double) function
```
---

### What is operator overloading in C++?

Operator overloading in C++ is a feature that allows you to define how operators (such as +, -, *, /, =, ==, etc.) behave when used with your own custom data types (classes). This enables you to make your classes behave more intuitively and integrate them seamlessly into the existing C++ syntax.

```
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int value) : m_value(value) {}

    MyClass operator+(const MyClass& other) {
        return MyClass(m_value + other.m_value);
    }

    bool operator==(const MyClass& other) {
        return m_value == other.m_value;
    }

private:
    int m_value;
};


MyClass obj1(5);
MyClass obj2(10);
MyClass obj3 = obj1 + obj2; // Calls the overloaded operator+
bool areEqual = (obj1 == obj2); // Calls the overloaded operator==
```
---

### Define Inline Function.

An inline function in C++ is a special type of function that is expanded by the compiler at the point of the function call, rather than being a separate function call in the compiled code.

```
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    int result = square(5);
    std::cout << "The square of 5 is: " << result << std::endl; // Output: The square of 5 is: 25

}
```
---

### Define class using C++.


```
class ClassName {
private:
    // Member variables (data)
    data_type member_variable1;
    data_type member_variable2;
    // ...

public:
    // Member functions (methods)
    return_type member_function1(parameters) {
        // Function body
    }
    return_type member_function2(parameters) {
        // Function body
    }
    // ...

    // Constructors and destructors (optional)
    ClassName() {
        // Constructor body
    }
    ~ClassName() {
        // Destructor body
    }
};
```

---

### Explain constructors and destructors.

- Constructors are the member functions of the class that executes automatically whenever an object is created. Constructors have the same name as the class. Constructors initialize the class. Constructors canít have return type.

- Destructors are called when the objects are destroyed. Destructors are usually used to deallocate memory and do other cleanup for a class object and its class members when the object is destroyed. A destructor is called for a class object when that object passes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. A destructor takes no arguments and has no return type.

---

### When do you use this pointer?

In C++, the this pointer is a special pointer that is used within a class member function to refer to the current object (instance) of the class. The this pointer is automatically passed to every non-static member function and is used to access the member variables and member functions of the current object.


```
class MyClass {
private:
    int x;

public:
    void setX(int x) {
        this->x = x; // Use this->x to access the member variable x
    }
};
```

or for Chaining Member Functions:

```
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass& setX(int x) {
        this->x = x;
        return *this; // Return the current object
    }

    MyClass& setY(int y) {
        this->y = y;
        return *this; // Return the current object
    }
};

// Example usage:
MyClass obj;
obj.setX(10).setY(20); // Method chaining
```

or for Implementing Copy Constructors and Assignment Operators:

```
class MyClass {
private:
    int x;
    int y;

public:
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        this->x = other.x;
        this->y = other.y;
    }

    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        this->x = other.x;
        this->y = other.y;
        return *this;
    }
};
```

---

### What is new and delete operator?

+ new 
```
int* ptr = new int; // Allocate memory for a single integer
int* arr = new int[10]; // Allocate memory for an array of 10 integers
```
+ delete

```
delete ptr; // Deallocate the memory for the single integer
delete[] arr; // Deallocate the memory for the array of 10 integers
```

---
### Explain the difference between structures and classes.

Syntactically and functionally, both structures and classes are identical. By default, members of structures have public accessibility and public inheritance from their parent(s), while members of classes are private and inherit privately from their parent(s).

 Default Access Specifier
> - Structures (struct): The default access specifier for members of a structure is public.
> - Classes (class): The default access specifier for members of a class is private.
> 

 Object-Oriented Programming

> - Structures (struct): Structures are primarily used for grouping related data elements together, without a strong emphasis on OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
> - Classes (class): Classes are the fundamental building blocks of OOP in C++. They provide features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, allowing for the creation of more complex and modular programs.

---

### Define local class in C++.

Local classes are not commonly used in C++ compared to global or member classes, but they can be helpful in specific scenarios where you need to encapsulate functionality within a limited scope, or when you want to hide implementation details from the rest of the program.

```
return_type function_name() {
    class local_class_name {
        // class members and methods
    };

    // Use the local class within the function
    local_class_name object;
    // ...
}
```

---

### Explain container class and its types in C++.

In C++, container classes are a set of data structures that are used to store and manage collections of elements. These containers provide various operations and functions to manipulate the stored elements, such as insertion, deletion, access, and traversal.

The main types of container classes in C++, provided by the Standard Template Library (STL), are:

> Sequential Containers: 

- Array: A fixed-size container that stores a collection of elements of the same type.
- Vector: A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.
- Deque (Double-Ended Queue): A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal at both the beginning and the end.
- List: A doubly-linked list that provides constant-time insertion and deletion at any position.
- Forward List: A singly-linked list that provides constant-time insertion and deletion at the beginning.

> Associative Containers:

- Set: A collection of unique elements sorted in ascending order.
- Multiset: A collection of elements sorted in ascending order, allowing duplicate elements.
- Map: A collection of key-value pairs sorted by the keys in ascending order.
- Multimap: A collection of key-value pairs sorted by the keys in ascending order, allowing duplicate keys.

> Unordered Containers:

- Unordered Set: A collection of unique elements in no particular order.
- Unordered Multiset: A collection of elements in no particular order, allowing duplicate elements.
- Unordered Map: A collection of key-value pairs in no particular order.
- Unordered Multimap: A collection of key-value pairs in no particular order, allowing duplicate keys.

> Adaptor Containers:
- Stack: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) container that provides push, pop, and top operations.
- Queue: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) container that provides enqueue, dequeue, and front operations.
- Priority Queue: A container that maintains a priority queue, where the highest-priority element is always at the front.

---

### Define an Iterator class.

In C++, an iterator is an object that provides a way to access and manipulate the elements of a container (such as a vector, list, or set) sequentially, without exposing the internal structure of the container.

The Iterator class in C++ is an abstract base class that defines the interface for creating custom iterators. It provides the basic operations and functionality required for iterating over the elements of a container.

```
#include <iostream>

// Custom iterator class for a simple array
template <typename T>
class ArrayIterator {
private:
    T* current;

public:
    // Constructor
    ArrayIterator(T* ptr) : current(ptr) {}

    // Dereference operator
    T& operator*() {
        return *current;
    }

    // Increment operator
    ArrayIterator& operator++() {
        ++current;
        return *this;
    }

    // Decrement operator
    ArrayIterator& operator--() {
        --current;
        return *this;
    }

    // Equality operator
    bool operator==(const ArrayIterator& other) {
        return current == other.current;
    }

    // Inequality operator
    bool operator!=(const ArrayIterator& other) {
        return current != other.current;
    }
};

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    ArrayIterator<int> it(arr);

    // Iterate over the array
    for (; it != ArrayIterator<int>(arr + 5); ++it) {
        std::cout << *it << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---
and also we can answer this question in another way like this:

A container class hold group of objects and iterator class is used to traverse through the objects maintained by a container class. The iterator class provides access to the classes inside a container. They are objects that point to other objects. Iterator points to one element in a range, and then it is possible to increment it so that it points to the next element.
There are several different types of iterators:
   - input_iterator
   - output_iterator
   - forward_iterator
   - bidirectional_iterator
   - random_iterator
   - reverse_iterator

I recommend to search about them.

### Define storage classes in C++.

Storage class defined for a variable determines the accessibility and longevity of the variable. The accessibility of the variable relates to the portion of the program that has access to the variable. The longevity of the variable refers to the length of time the variable exists within the program.


- Auto:
Automatic variable, also called as local variable and it has scope only within the function block where it is defined.

- External:
External variable are defined outside any function and memory is set aside for this type of variable once it is declared and remained until the end of the program. These variables are also called global variables.

- Static:
The static automatic variables, as with local variables, are accessible only within the function in which it is defined. Static automatic variables exist until the program ends in the same manner as external variables. In order to maintain value between function calls, the static variable takes its presence.


### Define namespace in C++.

Namespaces groups together entities like classes, objects and functions under a name. Namespaces provide a way to avoid name collisions of variables, types, classes or functions. Namespaces reduces the use of nested class thus reduces the inconvenience of handling nested class.

example:

```
namespace MyNamespace {
    int x = 10;
    void myFunction() {
        std::cout << "This is a function in MyNamespace." << std::endl;
    }
}


std::cout << MyNamespace::x << std::endl;  // Accessing the variable x in MyNamespace
MyNamespace::myFunction();  // Calling the function myFunction() in MyNamespace
```

### Define access privileges in C++.

- **private**

If data are declared as private in a class then it is accessible by the member functions of the class where they are declared. The private member functions can be accessed only by the members of the class. By default, any member of the class is considered as private by the C++ compiler, if no specifier is declared for the member.


- **public**

The member functions with public access specifier can be accessed outside of the class. This kind of members is accessed by creating instance of the class.

- **protected**

Protected members are accessible by the class itself and it's sub-classes. The members with protected specifier act exactly like private as long as they are referenced within the class or from the instance of the class. This specifier specially used when you need to use inheritance facility of C++. The protected members become private of a child class in case of private inheritance, public in case of public inheritance, and stay protected in case of protected inheritance.

```
class Base {
protected:
    int protectedVariable;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void accessProtectedVariable() {
        // Can access protectedVariable because Derived inherits from Base
        protectedVariable = 10;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base b;
    // b.protectedVariable = 5; // Error: protectedVariable is not accessible
    
    Derived d;
    d.accessProtectedVariable(); // Can access protectedVariable through the derived class
    
    return 0;
}
```

note: main difference between protected and private is this: **you can't change private variables from child classes but for protected you can**

---

### What is the default access level?

The access privileges in C++ are private, public and protected. The default access level assigned to members of a class is private. Private members of a class are accessible only within the class and by friends of the class. Protected members are accessible by the class itself and its sub- classes. Public members of a class can be accessed by anyone.

---

### Explain friend class in C++.

When a class declares another class as its friend, it is giving complete access to all its data and methods including private and protected data and methods to the friend class member methods. Friendship is one way only, which means if A declares B as its friend it does NOT mean that A can access private data of B. It only means that B can access all data of A.

```
class ClassA {
private:
    // members
    friend class ClassB;
};

class ClassB {
    // members can access private and protected members of ClassA
};
```

---

### What is virtual function?

A virtual function is a member function in a C++ base class that is designed to be overridden in derived classes. The key purpose of a virtual function is to enable dynamic method dispatch, which allows the correct function implementation to be called at runtime based on the actual type of the object, rather than the compile-time type.

```
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        std::cout << "The animal makes a sound." << std::endl;
    }
};
```

and:

```
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "The dog barks." << std::endl;
    }
};
```

so:

```
Animal* animal = new Dog();
animal->makeSound(); // Output: "The dog barks."
```

---

### What are pure virtual functions?

In C++, a pure virtual function is a special type of virtual function that has no implementation in the base class. It is declared using the = 0 syntax.

```
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() = 0;
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "The dog barks." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << "The cat meows." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* animal1 = new Dog();
    animal1->makeSound(); // Output: "The dog barks."

    Animal* animal2 = new Cat();
    animal2->makeSound(); // Output: "The cat meows."

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Define default constructor.

In C++, a default constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created without any arguments.

```
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        // Default constructor implementation
        x = 0;
        y = 0;
    }

    // Other member functions and variables
    int x, y;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1; // Calls the default constructor
    MyClass obj2 = MyClass(); // Calls the default constructor

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Define abstraction.

The process of hiding unnecessary data and exposing essential features is called abstraction. Abstraction is separating the logical properties from implementation details.

---

### What is overriding?

Defining a function in the derived class with same name as in the parent class is called overriding. In C++, the base class member can be overridden by the derived class function with the same signature as the base class function. Method overriding is used to provide different implementations of a function so that a more specific behavior can be realized.

---

### What is copy constructor?

In C++, a copy constructor is a special member function that is used to create a new object by copying the contents of an existing object of the same class.

```
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int value) : data(new int(value)) {}
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : data(new int(*other.data)) {}
    ~MyClass() { delete data; }

    int* data;
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1(10);
    MyClass obj2(obj1); // Calls the copy constructor

    // Modifying obj1 does not affect obj2
    *obj1.data = 20;
    std::cout << "*obj1.data: " << *obj1.data << std::endl;
    std::cout << "*obj2.data: " << *obj2.data << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

### C++ supports multiple inheritance. What is the "diamond problem" that can occur with multiple inheritance? Give an example.

In C++, multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes. While multiple inheritance provides a powerful feature, it can also lead to a problem known as the "diamond problem".

The diamond problem occurs when a derived class inherits from two base classes, and those base classes have a common base class. This can lead to ambiguity, as the derived class may have access to multiple versions of the same member (function or variable) from the common base class.

```
class Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        std::cout << "Animal speaks" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Cat : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        std::cout << "Cat meows" << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        std::cout << "Dog barks" << std::endl;
    }
};

class CatDog : public Cat, public Dog {
public:
    // The diamond problem occurs here
    void testSpeak() {
        // Which version of speak() should be called?
        speak();
    }
};

int main() {
    CatDog cd;
    cd.testSpeak(); // Ambiguous: which speak() should be called?
    return 0;
}
```
