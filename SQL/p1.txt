Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).

Examples
countBy(1,10)  should return  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
countBy(2,5)  should return {2,4,6,8,10}


-- # write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'counter' with columns 'x' (int) and 'n' (int)
-- return a query with columns 'x', 'n' and your result in a column named 'res' (array)
-- sort results by column 'x' ascending, then by 'n' ascending
-- note that each pair of 'x' and 'n' in 'counter' is unique 



CREATE FUNCTION countBy(x INT, n INT) RETURNS INT[]

AS $$

DECLARE
  result INT[];

BEGIN
  SELECT array_agg(i)
  INTO result
  FROM generate_series(x, x*n, x) AS i;
  RETURN result;
END;

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;



SELECT countBy(1,10) AS result;
